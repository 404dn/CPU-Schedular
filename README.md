## About The Project



<h4>
  <p>
  This project serves as a visual representation of CPU scheduling algorithms, which are essential in efficiently managing the CPU's resources. CPU scheduling involves the selection of the next process to be granted exclusive access to the CPU, ensuring optimal CPU utilization without idle time

## Featuers

<h2>Algorithm Selection  </h2>

</p>

<h3>
  <p>
  Users can choose from a variety of CPU scheduling algorithms, including First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job Next (SJN), Round Robin, Priority Scheduling, and more. The tool supports customization to accommodate different scheduling policies.
</h3>




<h2>Ready Queue</h2>

</p>
<h4>
  <p>
  Once tasks are entered, the program employs the selected scheduling algorithm to arrange them in the Ready Queue. This arrangement reflects the order in which processes will be given CPU time.
</h4>



<h2>Excuting</h2>

</p>

<h4>
  <p>
  The program simulates the execution of tasks one by one, following the chosen scheduling algorithm. The execution time for each task depends on the number of bursts required for its completion, providing an accurate representation of real-world scenarios.
